## **AI and Data Science Coursework â€“ Supervised Learning, CNN, and AI Ethics**
This repository contains my complete submission for a three-part coursework project as part of my studies in AI and Data Science. Each section involves practical implementation, evaluation, and reporting of different machine learning and AI techniques with both structured and unstructured data. The exercises test a wide range of applied machine learning skillsâ€”from predictive modelling to clustering, image recognition using deep learning, and critical analysis of AI ethics.

### **ðŸ“˜ Exercise 1: Analysing Second-Hand Car Sales Data** 
* **Objective:**
To explore and compare the performance of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms on a large-scale dataset representing second-hand car sales in the UK. This dataset contains 55,000 rows with attributes such as manufacturer, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and price.

* **Approach:**

Supervised Learning:

* Built and compared multiple regression models using numerical and categorical features to predict car prices.

* Compared linear regression and polynomial regression using individual input variables.

* Developed multivariate regression models, Random Forest Regressor, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

* Evaluated each model's accuracy using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².

* **Unsupervised Learning:**

* Applied k-Means clustering with various combinations of numerical features.

* Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

* Compared k-Means results with another clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering).

* Visualised clustering outcomes to explore hidden patterns in car attributes.

* **Deliverables:**

* Predictive analysis identifying the best models for car price estimation.

* Clustering insights into patterns in the vehicle data.

* Performance comparisons with relevant plots, metrics, and justifications.

### **ðŸ“— Exercise 2: Image Recognition Using CNN on the MNIST Dataset** 
* **Objective:**
To develop, tune, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate classification of handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset.

* **Approach:**

* Constructed a CNN architecture consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling, dropout, and dense layers.

* Applied activation functions such as ReLU and softmax for efficient learning and classification.

* Implemented regularisation techniques including dropout layers and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

* Conducted hyperparameter tuning (e.g., epochs, learning rate, batch size, kernel size) to optimise model performance.

* Visualised learning curves and confusion matrices to assess classification accuracy and overfitting.

* **Key Evaluations:**

* Training and validation accuracy/loss plots.

* Model performance metrics including overall accuracy and per-class performance.

* Discussion of the architectureâ€™s design choices and regularisation strategies.

### **ðŸ“™ Exercise 3: Literature Review â€“ Ethical Applications of AI** 
* **Objective:**
To critically review and summarise three journal articles that address the ethical dimensions of AI, focusing on themes such as transparency, fairness, explainability, and socially responsible AI.

* **Approach:**

* Selected peer-reviewed papers in the area of Fairness and Bias in AI Applications.

* **For each article:**

* Summarised its aims, contributions, methodologies, and findings.

* Analysed its strengths and limitations from an ethical perspective.

* Identified three key successes and three pressing challenges currently facing ethical AI development.

* Concluded with three actionable suggestions for bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical implementation of ethical AI systems.

* **Topics Covered:**

* Algorithmic transparency

* Discrimination and bias mitigation

* Accountability in automated decision-making systems

* Human-centric and inclusive AI practices

### **Conclusion**

This assignment not only demonstrates my ability to handle end-to-end data preprocessing but also my capability to communicate insights visually. The workflows implemented here are scalable, reusable, and can be directly applied to larger real-world datasets. These are essential skills for a data scientist, as the foundation of all advanced analytics lies in well-prepared and well-understood data.
