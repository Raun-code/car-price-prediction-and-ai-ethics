# car-price-prediction-and-ai-ethics
This repository contains solutions to three exercises involving machine learning and AI ethics:

Exercise 1 – Car Price Prediction:
Using regression models, random forest, neural networks, and clustering algorithms (k-means, etc.) to analyze a mock second-hand car sales dataset.

Exercise 2 – Handwritten Digit Recognition:
Development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, with hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques.

Exercise 3 – Ethical Applications of AI:
A literature review on explainability, fairness, trustworthiness, and socially responsible AI. Highlights include key successes, current gaps, and recommendations for ethical AI practices.
