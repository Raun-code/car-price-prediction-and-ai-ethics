### üìò **Exercise 1: Analysing Second-Hand Car Sales Data**

**üìù Objective**
To explore and compare the performance of various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms using a mock dataset of second-hand car sales in the UK (55,000 entries). The dataset includes attributes such as manufacturer, model, engine size, fuel type, year, mileage, and sale price.



#### üîπ **Supervised Learning Approach**

* Developed and compared regression models using both numerical and categorical variables to predict car prices.
* Tested individual numerical features (e.g., mileage, engine size) using:

  * **Linear Regression**
  * **Polynomial Regression**
* Built multi-variable regression models using:

  * **Multivariate Linear Regression**
  * **Random Forest Regressor**
  * **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
* Evaluated models using:

  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  * R¬≤ Score



#### üîπ **Unsupervised Learning Approach**

* Applied **k-Means Clustering** using different combinations of numerical input features.
* Determined the optimal number of clusters using:

  * **Elbow Method**
  * **Silhouette Score**
* Compared performance with alternative clustering algorithms:

  * **DBSCAN**
  * **Agglomerative Clustering**
* Visualised cluster distributions to identify hidden groupings in vehicle sales.



#### üìå **Key Deliverables**

* Performance comparison across all regression models with metrics and visualisations.
* Identification of the most predictive features for car price.
* Clustering insights to detect underlying market patterns or car segments.
* Summary report with model comparison and recommendations.

### üìó **Exercise 2: Image Recognition Using CNN on the MNIST Dataset**

**üìù Objective**
To develop a deep learning model (CNN) that can accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.



#### üîπ **Model Architecture**

* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using:

  * Convolutional Layers
  * MaxPooling Layers
  * Fully Connected Dense Layers
  * Dropout Layers for regularisation
* Activation functions used:

  * **ReLU** (hidden layers)
  * **Softmax** (output layer)



#### üîπ **Regularisation Techniques**

* **Dropout Layers** to prevent overfitting
* **Early Stopping** to monitor validation loss and halt training at optimal point



#### üîπ **Hyperparameter Tuning**

* Optimised key parameters such as:

  * Epochs
  * Batch size
  * Learning rate
  * Kernel size
* Evaluated performance using:

  * Accuracy curves
  * Confusion matrix
  * Loss curves



#### üìå **Key Deliverables**

* Final model performance with >98% accuracy on test set
* Visual comparison of training vs validation accuracy/loss
* Discussion of architecture design and model improvements



### üìô **Exercise 3: Literature Review ‚Äì Ethical Applications of AI**

**üìù Objective**
To evaluate three peer-reviewed academic papers focused on ethical aspects of AI. This review focuses on **Fairness and Bias in AI applications**.



#### üîπ **Methodology**

* Selected three recent and relevant academic papers
* For each article:

  * Summarised key objectives, methodologies, and findings
  * Evaluated strengths and ethical concerns
  * Compared real-world relevance of proposed frameworks



#### üîπ **Analysis Highlights**

* **Three Successes in Ethical AI:**

  * Transparency in algorithmic decision-making
  * Fairness in model outputs via bias mitigation
  * Socially responsible design frameworks

* **Three Gaps/Challenges:**

  * Lack of universal ethical guidelines across industries
  * Trade-off between accuracy and fairness
  * Incomplete transparency in proprietary systems

* **Three Recommendations:**

  * Adoption of open-source auditing tools
  * Inclusion of ethics-by-design in development lifecycles
  * Greater emphasis on interdisciplinary AI governance

### ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

This coursework showcases:

* End-to-end data analysis workflows from preprocessing to evaluation
* Competence in implementing, tuning, and comparing machine learning and deep learning models
* Ability to synthesise research and apply ethical frameworks to real-world AI challenges

Each component demonstrates technical, analytical, and ethical skills critical to an AI practitioner, with reusable and scalable code suitable for industry-level projects.
